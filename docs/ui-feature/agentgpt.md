## Overview

Contact center agents have several challenges irrespective of the industry to which they belong, the common ones being:

*   **New agent struggles:** It's tough for new agents to learn everything quickly.
*   **Knowledge pressure:** Expected to be experts on all topics.
*   **Inconsistence in answers:** Agents have varying levels of expertise and give different answers, which can frustrate customers.
*   **Fear of asking for help** because they’re afraid to look dumb.
*   **Customer frustration:** Putting customers on hold to search for information can lead to further frustration.
*   **Note-taking struggles:** Balancing note-taking with maintaining focus on the conversation.
*   **Overwhelming workload:** High call volume, limited support, and emotional exhaustion.

To address these challenges, **Zumo AI** has designed **AgentGPT** and **Suggested Queries,** AI-powered solutions that empower your agents to deliver exceptional customer service.

## Suggested Queries

We recognize that managing a conversation with both a customer and a bot simultaneously can be challenging for agents. **Suggested Queries** simplifies the use of AgentGPT, making it easier for agents to access their knowledge base. Here's how it works:

*   **Real-time Conversation Analysis**: **Level AI**'s models analyze the conversation between the agent and the customer in real-time, identifying the customer's intent and the topic of discussion.
*   **Intelligent Query Suggestions**: Based on the conversation analysis, **Suggested Queries** presents the agent with a list of relevant queries that are likely to yield helpful information from **AgentGPT**.
*   **Help with probing questions:** Sometimes, it’s not clear what exactly a customer is asking about. In this case, **Suggested Queries** could help you formulate questions to ask the customer in order to understand what their problem actually is.
*   **Agent Selection and Information Retrieval**: Finally, simply select the most appropriate query from the list, and **AgentGPT** instantly retrieves the relevant information from across your knowledge base.

### Benefits of Suggested Queries

▶ **Less thinking, more doing:** You don't have to figure out what questions to ask the bot during a call. **Suggested Queries** displays a variety of relevant questions that you can simply click for an answer; so, you can focus on the customer.

▶ **Faster answers:** Get the information you need quickly, so you can help customers faster and spend less time on each call.

▶ **Accurate Answers**: **Suggested Queries** ensures that you receive the most relevant information, so you can give accurate and consistent responses during your interactions.

## Example - AgentGPT and Suggested Queries in action

Imagine a customer calls in to inquire about returning a product. As the agent converses with the customer, **Suggested Queries** might offer options such as: _Return shipping label request_, _How to initiate a return_, and _Return policy for online purchases_.

The agent can then select the most relevant query, and **AgentGPT** will provide the necessary information from the knowledge base, allowing the agent to quickly and accurately address the customer's request.
