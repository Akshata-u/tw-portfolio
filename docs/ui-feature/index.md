!!! abstract "KEEP IN MIND"
     **_Natural language_** support articles prioritize natural language, flow, and formatting so they can be read and understood easily by humans, while **_chatbot-compatible_** support articles are specifically structured and formatted for automated systems to easily ingest and process.
     The two formats have different goals and are often used together, with chatbots directing users to the more detailed, human-friendly content.
