## For Agents

### **How do I log in?**

**A:** You can either use the SSOs available with your organization or use your Level AI credentials (please check with your IT department if you don’t have this).

### **When do Knowledge Cards pop up?**

**A:**Knowledge cards automatically appear when the AI system detects something in the conversation that can be explained with an article that is currently available in your company's Knowledge Base.

### **Why should I trust AgentGPT responses?**

**A:** The underlying sources from which AgentGPT extracts information is provided right below the response, so you can verify its accuracy.

### **How do I give feedback when the AI is wrong?**

**A:** Please use the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to provide feedback to the AI system, which should improve over time.

### **What do I do if the conversation is not loading in Agent Assist?**

**A:** If nothing is loading at all, including the real-time transcript at the bottom, it most likely is an issue with streaming the calls from your CCaaS. Please reach out to your manager to raise a ticket and the Level AI Support team will follow up accordingly.
