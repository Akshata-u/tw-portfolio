# Homepage Introduction

!!! quote "Keep in mind"
    This is an example of a chatbot-compatible help article.

## Short Description
The **Homepage** is your daily dashboard. It displays goals, reminders, key conversations, scorecards, charts, and filters tailored to your role. Use it to track progress, review tasks, and refresh data with one click.

The **Homepage** acts like your control panel; a quick snapshot of everything that matters right now.  
At a glance, you can see goals, reminders, team conversations, metrics, and charts.  
Why it matters: Unlike detailed reports (historical deep dives), the **Homepage** gives you a live feed of activity to guide your daily and weekly decisions.
