In today's fast-paced world, understanding every customer interaction is crucial. Nowhere is this more critical than in contact centers, where every word matters. Enter **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: the unsung hero of customer experience. Let’s explore how this powerful technology, and STT solutions such as **Zumo AI's Orba**, are transforming the way businesses listen, learn, and lead.

### **What is Speech-to-Text (STT)?**

Speech-to-Text (also known as Automatic Speech Recognition or ASR) converts spoken language into text. It’s like a superpowered digital notetaker; instantly transcribing customer calls, sales conversations, or supporting chats into searchable text. From everyday voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa to high-stakes use in healthcare or legal settings, STT is everywhere\!

### **When STT Fails, So Does CX**

The accuracy of STT is non-negotiable. Imagine an agent trying to resolve an issue based on a garbled transcript. Poor STT quality can lead to:

* **Misunderstandings:** Incorrect transcriptions can lead to errors in customer service and data analysis. For example, a customer saying "product ID X-250B" could be transcribed as "eggs two fifty bee," causing confusion all around.  
* **Lost Insights:** Missed keywords and sentiment can hide crucial customer pain points; businesses lose valuable data that could be the foundation for major product improvements or service enhancements. For instance, you might miss a surge of calls complaining about a particular service if the STT isn't accurate enough to flag it.  
* **Wasted Time:** Correcting errors and clarifying misunderstandings takes time and resources, adding to operational costs. Agents have to manually verify information that the STT system got wrong, slowing down the entire chain of service.

Bad STT means higher costs, frustrated customers, and missed opportunities. So, how do you avoid this trap?

Test\! Test\! Test\! You must always cross-check whether an STT solution is compatible with your data.

### **Not All STT Are Created Equal**

STT performance is often measured by **Word Error Rate (WER)**. However, it has been observed frequently that any STT solution built over generic AI models struggle to remain accurate in real-world contact center scenarios— they’re unable to recognize industry-specific jargon, complex alphanumeric strings such as account numbers or product codes and moreover, unable to deal with accents, dialects and background noise. This is where **customization** is crucial. An STT solution that allows you to finetune the underlying AI models with your unique industry data significantly improves accuracy, making them truly effective for your business.
