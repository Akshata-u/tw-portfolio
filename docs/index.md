# Technical Writing Portfolio

Hi I'm **Akshata**, a technical writer who turns complex products into clear, shippable, and genuinely useful docs.
I partner closely with Product, Design and Engineering teams; and work frequently with Support and GTM teams so documentation launches with the feature, not after it!

Business outcomes I achieve: faster onboarding (internal and external), fewer tickets, higher adoption. My areas of documentation expertise span UI and API docs, in-app guidance (walkthroughs/ tooltips), release notes, and enablement assets; underpinned by appropriate information architecture, versioning (where required), and  review workflows.

What sets me apart is the blend of strategy and craft. I can design a scalable content system and also write the words, examples, and visuals that help users succeed. My site houses a collection of various types of documentation written by me to give you an idea of my writing style and skills.
